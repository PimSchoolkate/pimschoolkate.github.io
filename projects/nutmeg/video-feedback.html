                What characteristics does a useful video for training have?
            </p>

            <p class="font-justify">
                The most <b>important</b> characteristic of a video is that atleast one object moves (either the camara or the ball, or something in the background like leggs or a dog). If everything is static, the video is simply a long image, and thus it is more useful to just make a picture (otherwise I have to examine the quality of each video). A video is <b>better</b> if there is more moving objects and there is as many other objects as possible. For example, multiple balls, multiple players, a moving camara and a moving ball, preferably were background objects appear and disappear during the video, introducing more variety.

            <p class="font-justify">
                These videos are great because multiple things happend: the ball is moving, there is a lot of distracting objects in the background, the legs are moving, the camara is moving, the ball is moving fast so that it appears blurred in some of the frames, and even another objects appears in some of the frames.

                Even though these videos are great as is, to make these videos even more useful the following could be done. For the first video, having more objects moving or moving the camera would be great. For the second video, having more objects in the background would be great as right now, the background is only the floor, which does not contain many distractions. For the third video, having more objects on the stairs would be great, as right now the background is only the stairs, which does not contain many distractions.

            <p class="font-justify">
                These videos are not so useful for the following general reasons. There is no movement in the video (neither the camara or the ball is moving), making it similar to an image. The background is monotone, there is nothing else except for the floor.

            For the first video, it simply the movement that is lacking. The great thing about this video is that there is a rich background with many shapes. The second video is lacking in this richness, although there is slight movement, this is not enough and as the background is monotone, the different frames are nearly indistinguishable. The third video has amazing background, specifically, the green circle in the puzzle floor is great as the AI will have to learn to distinguish a circle in the floor with an actual soccer ball. However, as with all other videos, nothing is moving, making it equal to an image.
