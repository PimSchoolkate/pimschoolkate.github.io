            <p class="text-justify">
                This hand-in was built using the JavaScript D3 library. Reason for this is to apply previously learned skills from another course in order to further develop these skills. Besides, using this format gives the advantage of showing the results in a more animated and interactive way.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Of course, the assignment was first done in R, to be later programmed in JavaScript. This required to manually build a beta probability density function that is able to provide the data for the plots that can be seen below. One obstacle that had to be overcome was the computation of the factorial in the gamma function, which explodes to infinity when not using the natural log method.
                In the end, code from  <a href="https://github.com/royhzq/betajs" target="_blank">Royhzq</a> was used.

                Introduction to problem
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                We are asked to model the prior beliefs of two students in Baix de Llobregat concerning the the proportion of the population that support building a large casino in Baix de Llobregat.
                Anna's (a local) prior belief is that the average amount of people that support the casino is 20% and that this average has a standard deviation of 8%.
                Sam (an exchange student) does not have any prior beliefs and thus does not have a clear idea if people would be in favor or against a large casino.
                As the probability of the support for the casino follows a Binomial distribution, beta distributions for the priors are used so that the posterior distribution can be modeled with a Beta distribution as well.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                In order to model these prior beliefs, we use the Beta distribution, which is described as:
                \[\text{betaPDF} = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)}x^{\alpha-1}(1-x)^{\beta -1}\]
                Where the gamma function \(\Gamma(z)\) is defined as:
                \[\Gamma(z) = (z-1)!\]
                For the expectation \(\mathbb{E}[x]\) and the variance \(\text{Var}[x]\) of the beta distribution we know that:
                \[\mathbb{E}[x]=\frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta}\]
                \[\text{Var}[x]=\frac{\alpha\beta}{(\alpha+\beta)^2(\alpha+\beta+1)}\]
            </p>

            <p class="font-weight-bold">
                Fitting the prior
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                Thus, in order to find the right \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) for both Anna and Sam, one needs to look at the expectation and variance.
                For Sam, this is easy. Simply \(\alpha=1\) and \(\beta=1\) results in a uniform prior beta distribution.
                For Anna, this means that \(\mathbb{E}[x]=0.2\) and \(\text{Var}=0.08^2\). Solving for \(\mathbb{E}[x]\) gives \(\beta=4\alpha\) and with \(\text{Var}[x]=0.08^\)
                we find that \(\alpha=4.8\) and \(\beta=19.2\)
            </p>

            <p class="font-weight-bold">
                Fitting the posterior
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                The posterior distribution, as mentioned above, also follows a Beta distribution, given the initial priors and the data. Given that prior \(\pi(\theta) \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha,\beta)\), it can be shown for the posterior that:
                \[p(\theta|y) = \frac{p(y|\theta)\pi(\theta)}{p(y)} \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha + N, \beta + N - Y)\]
                Where \(N\) is the amount of observations and \(Y\) is the amount of observations that, in this scenario, are in favor of a casino. Therefore, given any combination of \(N\) and \(Y\), the posterior distribution can be modeled.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                In the case of this assignment, the first batch of observations which was given which satisfied \(N=100\) and \(Y=26\), and the second batch of observations satisfied \(N=1000\) and \(Y=260\).
                In order to make a smooth animation in the graph, it was assumed that \(Y=\text{round}(0.26N)\). Note that the rounding was done because the implementation of the Beta distribution behaves weirdly when given decimal numbers (it would give vertical jitter for values of \(N\) next to each other. This jitter is now horizontal).
            </p>

            <p class="font-weight-bold">
                Visualization of the problem
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                The final visualization can be found below. The play button will make the graph incrementally increase the number of observations, which shows how the posterior distributions become more tailored towards the data as the observations increase. One can also manually slide the bar in order to inspect a desired number of observations \(N\).
                The selection menu allows for looking at different combinations of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) for the prior distribution of Anna.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                A legend is missing, as my time ran out and D3 is sometimes hard and confusing. Therefore, the grey lines correspond to Anna, and the blue lines to Sam. The dashed lines are the posterior distributions.
